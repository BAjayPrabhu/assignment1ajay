    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
    <main>
    <p>IT has always been interesting to me whether it was the arrival of GPS systems alleviating the need to be a constant front seat navigator. The steady rise of gaming, which was a great relief from having only one boardgame, monopoly. This led to me being the household IT support, whereby I would turn it of and on again and to the amazement of my parents, it worked.
  By taking this course I’m aiming at a career shift, for an industry which is becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives. I’m quite interested in how IT is being used for everyday assistance, for example, the Alexa, Siri and Google Home programs. Another field of IT which has drawn my interest though I currently understand it only a little, is Deep Learning.
