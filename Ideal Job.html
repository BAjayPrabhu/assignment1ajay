    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    <h2>Senior Mobile Developer - Android (<em>Hays Recruiting</em>)</h2>
      <p>This permanent position with a Tertiary Education provider offers a substantial salary ($100-130,000 and super) in Melbourne’s East. The candidate will be involved with mobile applications and relevant supporting infrastructure. The position will require a candidate able to work in a team environment with internal members who are also developers, as well as business related analysts and managers. The job being located in Melbourne is particularly appealing due to have most of my family within the region. Being involved in a long-term project which can bud into a career and can provide time and space for personal development would be incredible. </p>
      <p>List of necessary skills.</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Android SDK’s and Frameworks</li>
        <li>Kotlin</li>
        <li>Firebase and AWS (cloud platforms)</li>
        <li>Advance skills in HTML5, CSS3 (SASS) and JavaScriptJSON/RESTful APIs</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>While the job listing doesn’t specify a particular number of years’ worth or certificate type, they do require the candidate to have demonstrable and provable capacity with the skills listed above. This being a team-based job, the position requires someone who is a clear and capable communicator both written and verbal. </p>
      <p>At present my IT skillset is lacking and it is my hope that this course will provide me with the literacy and understanding of IT to fulfil such roles. Besides the RMIT IT course, I’ll be seeking to explore other coding languages in my own time and once I feel sufficiently capable, to seek part-time work which will enforce these skills with experience. I have however worked for the last 4 years in agriculture and in particular the wine industry wherein a strong work ethic, punctuality and willingness to put in long hours are essential. Teamwork has also been an essential component in day-to-day work and is a trait that moves between all industries. </p>
