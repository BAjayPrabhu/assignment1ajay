    <h1>Project</h1>
    <main>
    <p>To design and implement a scalable smart home irrigation system with the capacity to be monitored and managed remotely. To develop the system, I would utilize a Raspberry Pi 4, a solenoid valve, copper wiring and a power relay. This would also involve the development of an app for user input, to observe and monitor the system.  </p>
    <p>In my personal life I have been working the last four years in agricultural industries and have seen first hand the convenience of automated systems, and the hassle of non-automated systems of irrigation. Manual systems are time-consuming and prevent someone from being able to go out to social events, attend to necessary work or even sink five hours into session of gaming when you need to get up and turn a tap on or off, or swap zones every half hour or hour (or longer). With a functional automated system, even a vacation might be possible without recruiting a distant relative’s friend to manage it while you’re away.</p>
    <p>This project has multiple components which need to work in tandem in order to function properly, the software and the hardware. On the software side a user-based app to be coded in Android which could communicate data to the Raspberry Pi 4 (RB4). This app would be interface where the irrigation could be controlled and perhaps even be linked to weather data so that rainfall above a certain amount (1mm for example) would delay or prevent a watering program from operating. Similarly, this could work in the even of consecutive summer days exceeding 35°C to trigger an increase in water periods or frequency. Ideally the system would incorporate flow sensors to determine how much water is being used. This data could serve multiple purposes by keeping a user aware of general water usage and by functioning as a failsafe incase of a leak or break in a pipe. If the later were to happen and too much water was escaping (above a preprogrammed threshold) the system would shutdown and provide an alert. As regard the hardware the RB4 would be powered by maybe a 5 to 12volt relay which would then feed a solenoid valve bank from the local water source.</p>
    <p>The Android app would most likely be programmed using Kotlin or Java and Raspberry Pi 4 would require programming in Python or Java. When issues between the communication of the two ends of the system enter trouble, I would refer to online sources such as Stacked Overflow for assistance. </p>
